## PROJECT TITLE
Web Application Security Testing

## DESCRIPTION
This project focuses on conducting basic security testing on a sample web application to identify common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).  
The testing was performed on an intentionally vulnerable demo web application for learning and ethical purposes.

## OBJECTIVE
- Identify security vulnerabilities in a web application  
- Understand common web security risks  
- Document findings and mitigation strategies

## TESTED APPLICATION
